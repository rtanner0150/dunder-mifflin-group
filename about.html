                    <p>Dunder Mifflin Inc. (stock symbol DMI) is a mid-cap regional paper- and office-supply distributor with an emphasis on servicing small-business clients. With a corporate office in New York City, Dunder Mifflin has branches in Akron, Ohio; Nashua, New Hampshire; Rochester, New York; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Syracuse, New York; and Utica, New York.</p>
                    <p>The company was founded by Robert Dunder and Robert Mifflin in 1949, where they supplied metal brackets. Eventually, the company started selling paper and opened several branches across the Northeastern United States.<br/>In 2009, the company went bankrupt, and was bought by printer company Sabre. In 2012, Sabre was dissolved and the company became Dunder Mifflin once again.</p>
                    <p>For years, Dunder Mifflin was a paper company that was unable to compete with modern chains such as Staples and Office Depot. The company still used calls rather than the Internet, causing most customers to leave for the nation-wide chains, and was unable to adapt to an increasingly paperless world. Ryan Howard, a new employee of Scranton Branch, predicted the company would be obsolete by 2017. In 2007, Ryan Howard became Vice President of Sales and began a massive restructuring of the entire company, including a new website that would help make sales more efficient. However, his website was a failure (due to an ill-advised social networking feature) and he was later arrested for fraud when it was discovered that he was double-counting sales transactions into the website that were already made by salesmen over the phone.</p>
